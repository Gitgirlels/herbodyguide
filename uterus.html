    <div class="container">
        <h1>The Uterus: The Complete Scientific Guide</h1>
        <div class="intro">
            The uterus represents one of the most remarkable organs in human biology, serving as the site of menstruation, embryonic development, and fetal growth throughout pregnancy. This hollow, muscular organ undergoes dramatic structural and functional changes throughout a woman's reproductive lifespan, responding to complex hormonal signals while maintaining the delicate balance necessary for reproductive health. This comprehensive guide examines the intricate anatomy and physiology of the uterus, explores the molecular mechanisms underlying its function, investigates common pathological conditions, and provides evidence-based insights into maintaining optimal uterine health through understanding the biological processes that govern this extraordinary organ.
        </div>

        <h2>Uterine Anatomy: Structure and Organization</h2>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h3>Gross Anatomical Structure</h3>
            <p>The adult uterus is a pear-shaped, hollow muscular organ measuring approximately 7.5 cm in length, 5 cm in width, and 2.5 cm in thickness, with an average weight of 40-50 grams in nulliparous women. <span class="highlight">The uterus consists of three distinct anatomical regions: the fundus (superior rounded portion), the body (central portion), and the cervix (inferior cylindrical portion)</span> that extends into the vaginal canal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            The uterine cavity is a potential space lined by endometrium, measuring approximately 6 cm from the external cervical os to the fundus. This triangular cavity communicates with the fallopian tubes at the cornua and with the vagina through the cervical canal, forming a continuous pathway for sperm transport and menstrual fluid drainage.
        </div>

        <h3>Histological Architecture: The Three-Layer System</h3>
        <p>The uterine wall consists of three distinct histological layers, each with specialized functions essential for reproductive physiology and pathological processes.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Endometrium: The Dynamic Lining</h4>
            <p>The endometrium represents the inner mucosal layer of the uterus, consisting of a functional layer (stratum functionalis) and a basal layer (stratum basalis). The functional layer undergoes cyclical regeneration, proliferation, secretory transformation, and shedding during each menstrual cycle, while the basal layer remains intact to provide stem cells for regeneration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Histological studies demonstrate that the endometrium contains over 400 different cell types, including epithelial cells, stromal cells, immune cells, and vascular endothelial cells. The endometrial thickness varies from 1-3 mm during menstruation to 8-15 mm during the late secretory phase, representing one of the most dramatic tissue remodeling processes in human biology.
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Myometrium: The Muscular Engine</h4>
            <p>The myometrium comprises the thick middle layer of smooth muscle arranged in three distinct layers: an outer longitudinal layer, a middle circular layer containing the major blood vessels, and an inner longitudinal layer. This complex arrangement enables the coordinated contractions necessary for menstruation, labor, and postpartum hemostasis.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Perimetrium: The Protective Covering</h4>
            <p>The perimetrium represents the outer serosal layer, consisting of visceral peritoneum that covers the uterine fundus and body. This layer provides mechanical protection and facilitates the organ's mobility within the pelvic cavity while maintaining anatomical relationships with surrounding structures.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Molecular Mechanisms of Uterine Function</h2>

        <h3>Hormonal Regulation: The Orchestrated Symphony</h3>
        <p>Uterine function depends on precise hormonal regulation involving complex feedback mechanisms between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovaries, and uterine tissues.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Estrogen Signaling Pathways</h4>
            <p>Estrogen exerts its effects through estrogen receptors alpha (ERα) and beta (ERβ), which function as ligand-activated transcription factors. <span class="highlight">ERα predominates in the uterus and mediates proliferative effects on endometrial epithelium and stroma</span>, while ERβ plays regulatory roles in vascular function and inflammation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Molecular studies reveal that estrogen activates over 2,000 genes in endometrial tissue, including those regulating cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. The temporal and spatial expression of estrogen-responsive genes determines the coordinated tissue changes observed during the menstrual cycle.
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Progesterone Signaling Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>Progesterone acts through progesterone receptors A and B (PRA and PRB), which have distinct but overlapping functions in uterine physiology. PRB primarily mediates proliferative responses, while PRA acts as a dominant negative regulator, fine-tuning progesterone action and preparing the endometrium for potential implantation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Genome-wide analysis shows that progesterone regulates approximately 3,500 genes in human endometrium, with peak effects occurring 6-8 hours after hormone exposure. These genes control crucial processes including secretory transformation, immune modulation, and vascular remodeling essential for establishing pregnancy or initiating menstruation.
        </div>

        <h3>Cellular Communication Networks</h3>
        <p>The uterus functions as an integrated organ system through sophisticated cellular communication involving paracrine, autocrine, and endocrine signaling mechanisms.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Growth Factors and Cytokines</h4>
            <p>Multiple growth factors regulate uterine function, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). These factors coordinate cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and tissue remodeling throughout the menstrual cycle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Prostaglandin Synthesis and Action</h4>
            <p>Prostaglandins, particularly PGE2 and PGF2α, play crucial roles in uterine physiology by regulating smooth muscle contractility, vascular tone, and inflammatory responses. The cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze prostaglandin synthesis, with COX-2 showing dramatic upregulation during menstruation and parturition.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Menstrual Cycle: Molecular Choreography</h2>

        <h3>Proliferative Phase: Building the Foundation</h3>
        <p>The proliferative phase represents a period of intense cellular activity driven by rising estrogen levels from developing ovarian follicles.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Endometrial Regeneration Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>Following menstruation, endometrial regeneration begins from the basal layer through activation of endometrial stem cells. These multipotent cells differentiate into epithelial and stromal lineages under estrogen stimulation, rapidly restoring the functional layer within 4-7 days.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Studies using lineage tracing demonstrate that endometrial stem cells located in the basalis express markers including SSEA-1, Musashi-1, and N-cadherin. These cells exhibit remarkable regenerative capacity, enabling the endometrium to undergo over 400 cycles of regeneration during a woman's reproductive lifespan without apparent senescence.
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            During the proliferative phase, endometrial thickness increases from 1-3 mm to 6-8 mm, representing a 3-8 fold increase in tissue volume. This growth involves both cellular proliferation (with mitotic indices reaching 15-20% in glandular epithelium) and extracellular matrix expansion, creating the structural foundation for potential embryo implantation.
        </div>

        <h3>Secretory Phase: Preparation for Implantation</h3>
        <p>The secretory phase transforms the proliferative endometrium into a receptive environment for embryo implantation through progesterone-mediated changes.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Glandular Secretory Transformation</h4>
            <p>Progesterone induces dramatic morphological and functional changes in endometrial glands, causing them to become tortuous and dilated while producing glycogen-rich secretions. These secretions contain nutrients, growth factors, and immune modulators essential for early embryonic development.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Stromal Cell Decidualization</h4>
            <p>Endometrial stromal cells undergo decidualization, transforming from spindle-shaped fibroblast-like cells to large, rounded decidual cells rich in glycogen and lipids. This process involves extensive gene expression changes affecting over 5,000 genes and creates a specialized microenvironment for embryo implantation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="trimester-box">
            <h3>Key Molecular Events in Decidualization</h3>
            <p><span class="highlight">cAMP Signaling:</span> Cyclic adenosine monophosphate activates protein kinase A and CREB<br>
            <span class="highlight">Transcription Factors:</span> FOXO1, MSX1, and HOXA10 regulate decidual gene expression<br>
            <span class="highlight">Growth Factors:</span> BMP2, Wnt4, and TGF-β coordinate cellular transformation<br>
            <span class="highlight">Cell Adhesion:</span> Cadherins and integrins facilitate cell-cell interactions<br>
            <span class="highlight">Metabolic Changes:</span> Increased glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis<br>
            <span class="highlight">Immune Modulation:</span> Production of immunosuppressive factors</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Menstruation: Controlled Tissue Breakdown</h3>
        <p>Menstruation represents a precisely controlled inflammatory process involving coordinated tissue breakdown, vascular changes, and immune cell activation.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Matrix Metalloproteinase Activation</h4>
            <p>The withdrawal of progesterone support triggers activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9, which degrade extracellular matrix components and facilitate endometrial shedding. This process is tightly regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) to prevent excessive tissue damage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Proteomic analysis reveals that over 200 proteins show significant changes during menstruation, including a 15-fold increase in MMP-9 activity and 8-fold increase in inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α. The coordinated expression of these factors ensures complete shedding of the functional layer while preserving the regenerative basalis.
        </div>

        <h2>Uterine Vascular Biology</h2>

        <h3>Spiral Artery Development and Function</h3>
        <p>The endometrial vascular system undergoes remarkable changes throughout the menstrual cycle, with spiral arteries serving as the primary regulatory vessels.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Angiogenesis and Vascular Remodeling</h4>
            <p>Endometrial angiogenesis involves both sprouting angiogenesis (formation of new vessels from existing ones) and vasculogenesis (de novo vessel formation). VEGF-A serves as the primary angiogenic factor, with its expression tightly regulated by oxygen tension, hormones, and growth factors throughout the menstrual cycle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            The endometrium exhibits one of the highest rates of physiological angiogenesis in the human body, with new vessel formation occurring every menstrual cycle. This process involves coordinated activation of endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells to create a functional vascular network within 4-6 days of menstruation.
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Vascular Regulation During Menstruation</h4>
            <p>Menstrual bleeding results from progressive vasoconstriction of spiral arteries lasting 4-24 hours, followed by vasodilation and endometrial shedding. This process is mediated by prostaglandins, endothelins, and nitric oxide, creating a controlled bleeding pattern that typically lasts 3-7 days.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Common Uterine Conditions: Pathophysiology and Mechanisms</h2>

        <h3>Endometriosis: Ectopic Endometrial Tissue</h3>
        <p>Endometriosis affects 6-10% of reproductive-age women and represents one of the most common causes of pelvic pain and infertility.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Molecular Mechanisms of Endometriosis</h4>
            <p>Endometriosis involves the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the pelvis. <span class="highlight">The condition results from a complex interplay of genetic susceptibility, immune dysfunction, hormonal influences, and environmental factors</span> that enable ectopic endometrial tissue to implant, survive, and proliferate in extrauterine locations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Genome-wide association studies have identified over 25 genetic loci associated with endometriosis risk, including variants in genes regulating cell adhesion (CDKN2A), hormone metabolism (CYP19A1), and DNA repair (MLH1). Women with affected first-degree relatives have a 6-9 fold increased risk of developing endometriosis, indicating strong genetic components to disease susceptibility.
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Inflammatory Pathways in Endometriosis</h4>
            <p>Endometriosis is characterized by chronic inflammation involving aberrant activation of macrophages, T-cells, and natural killer cells. Inflammatory mediators including IL-1β, TNF-α, and cyclooxygenase-2 create a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that promotes lesion growth, angiogenesis, and neuropathic pain development.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Research demonstrates that endometriotic lesions exhibit resistance to apoptosis through overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and survivin. This resistance to programmed cell death, combined with enhanced proliferative capacity and angiogenic potential, enables ectopic endometrial tissue to establish persistent lesions that respond cyclically to hormonal fluctuations.
        </div>

        <h3>Uterine Fibroids: Benign Smooth Muscle Tumors</h3>
        <p>Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) represent the most common benign tumors in women, affecting 70-80% of women by age 50.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Cellular Origins and Growth Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>Fibroids arise from clonal proliferation of smooth muscle cells within the myometrium, driven by chromosomal aberrations, growth factor signaling, and hormonal stimulation. Each fibroid develops from a single transformed smooth muscle cell that acquires unlimited proliferative potential through specific genetic alterations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Cytogenetic analysis reveals that 40-50% of uterine fibroids contain chromosomal aberrations, with deletions in chromosome 7q and rearrangements involving 12q14-15 being most common. The MED12 gene is mutated in 70% of fibroids, while HMGA2 overexpression occurs in 20% of cases, indicating multiple pathways leading to fibroid development.
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Extracellular Matrix Alterations</h4>
            <p>Fibroids are characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, particularly collagen I, collagen III, and fibronectin. This altered matrix composition contributes to the firm consistency of fibroids and may impair normal myometrial function, affecting menstrual flow patterns and fertility outcomes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="trimester-box">
            <h3>Fibroid Classification by Location</h3>
            <p><span class="highlight">Intramural:</span> Within the myometrial wall (70% of cases)<br>
            <span class="highlight">Subserosal:</span> Projecting toward the peritoneal cavity (20% of cases)<br>
            <span class="highlight">Submucosal:</span> Projecting into the uterine cavity (10% of cases)<br>
            <span class="highlight">Pedunculated:</span> Attached by a stalk to uterine surface<br>
            <span class="highlight">Parasitic:</span> Detached and receiving blood supply from other organs<br>
            <span class="highlight">Cervical:</span> Located within the cervical tissue (2-5% of cases)</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Adenomyosis: Endometrium Within the Myometrium</h3>
        <p>Adenomyosis involves the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium, affecting 20-35% of women and often coexisting with other uterine conditions.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Pathogenesis and Tissue Invasion</h4>
            <p>Adenomyosis results from invagination of the basalis endometrium into the myometrium through disruption of the normal junctional zone. <span class="highlight">This process involves breakdown of the normal barrier between endometrium and myometrium</span>, allowing endometrial tissue to migrate into smooth muscle layers where it establishes ectopic foci.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Molecular Mechanisms of Invasion</h4>
            <p>The development of adenomyosis involves aberrant expression of cell adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinases, and tissue inhibitors that normally maintain the endometrial-myometrial boundary. Dysregulation of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) pathways facilitates endometrial invasion into myometrial tissue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            MRI studies demonstrate that the junctional zone in women with adenomyosis is significantly thicker (>8-12 mm) compared to normal women (2-4 mm). Histological analysis reveals that adenomyotic foci are surrounded by smooth muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy, with myometrial thickness increased by 40-60% compared to normal uteri.
        </div>

        <h2>Hormonal Influences on Uterine Pathology</h2>

        <h3>Estrogen Dominance and Disease Risk</h3>
        <p>Prolonged exposure to estrogen without adequate progesterone opposition increases the risk of several uterine conditions.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Endometrial Hyperplasia</h4>
            <p>Endometrial hyperplasia results from unopposed estrogen stimulation, leading to excessive proliferation of endometrial glands and stroma. The condition ranges from simple hyperplasia without atypia (1% cancer risk) to complex atypical hyperplasia (23-57% progression to endometrial cancer), depending on architectural complexity and cellular atypia.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Molecular studies reveal that endometrial hyperplasia involves dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoints, with overexpression of cyclin D1 and E1, and loss of tumor suppressor function through PTEN mutations occurring in 55-83% of cases. These alterations disrupt normal growth control mechanisms and create a pre-malignant environment.
        </div>

        <h3>Progesterone Resistance in Uterine Disease</h3>
        <p>Many uterine conditions involve acquired resistance to progesterone action, disrupting normal regulatory mechanisms.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Mechanisms of Progesterone Resistance</h4>
            <p>Progesterone resistance can result from altered progesterone receptor expression, cofactor availability, or downstream signaling pathways. In endometriosis and adenomyosis, decreased progesterone receptor B expression and increased inflammatory mediators impair progesterone's anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Gene expression analysis demonstrates that progesterone-resistant endometrial tissue shows differential expression of over 1,500 genes compared to normal tissue, including genes involved in steroid hormone signaling, inflammation, and tissue remodeling. This molecular signature correlates with clinical symptoms and treatment resistance patterns observed in various uterine conditions.
        </div>

        <h2>Uterine Cancer: Molecular Pathogenesis</h2>

        <h3>Endometrial Cancer: Most Common Gynecologic Malignancy</h3>
        <p>Endometrial cancer represents the fourth most common cancer in women and the most common gynecologic malignancy in developed countries.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Type I vs Type II Endometrial Cancers</h4>
            <p>Endometrial cancers are classified into two main types based on molecular characteristics. <span class="highlight">Type I cancers are estrogen-related, well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinomas with good prognosis</span>, while Type II cancers are estrogen-independent, poorly differentiated serous or clear cell carcinomas with aggressive behavior and poor outcomes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Molecular analysis reveals that Type I endometrial cancers harbor mutations in PTEN (50-80%), PIK3CA (30-50%), ARID1A (30-40%), and microsatellite instability (20-30%). Type II cancers more commonly show TP53 mutations (90%), HER2 amplification (30%), and chromosomal instability, reflecting distinct pathogenetic pathways to malignancy.
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Cancer Genome Atlas Molecular Classification</h4>
            <p>The Cancer Genome Atlas has identified four molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer: POLE ultramutated (excellent prognosis), microsatellite instability hypermutated (intermediate prognosis), copy number low (intermediate prognosis), and copy number high (poor prognosis). This classification provides more precise prognostic information than traditional histologic grading.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Uterine Sarcomas: Rare but Aggressive</h3>
        <p>Uterine sarcomas represent less than 5% of uterine malignancies but account for disproportionate mortality due to their aggressive behavior.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Leiomyosarcoma vs Leiomyoma</h4>
            <p>Distinguishing between benign leiomyomas and malignant leiomyosarcomas presents significant diagnostic challenges. Leiomyosarcomas typically show high mitotic activity (>10 mitoses per 10 high-power fields), significant nuclear atypia, and tumor necrosis, while leiomyomas lack these features.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Molecular studies demonstrate that leiomyosarcomas and leiomyomas have distinct genetic profiles, with leiomyosarcomas showing complex chromosomal aberrations, TP53 mutations (50-70%), and RB1 deletions (60-90%). In contrast, leiomyomas have simple chromosomal changes and maintain normal tumor suppressor function, supporting their fundamentally different biological behavior.
        </div>

        <h2>Infectious Diseases of the Uterus</h2>

        <h3>Endometritis: Inflammation of the Endometrial Lining</h3>
        <p>Endometritis represents infection and inflammation of the endometrial lining, classified as acute or chronic based on duration and histological features.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Acute Endometritis Pathophysiology</h4>
            <p>Acute endometritis typically results from ascending bacterial infection following childbirth, abortion, or invasive procedures. <span class="highlight">The condition involves neutrophilic infiltration of the endometrial stroma and glands</span>, with common causative organisms including Escherichia coli, group B Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and anaerobic bacteria.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Clinical studies demonstrate that postpartum endometritis occurs in 1-3% of vaginal deliveries and 5-15% of cesarean deliveries. Risk factors include prolonged labor (>18 hours), prolonged rupture of membranes (>12 hours), multiple vaginal examinations, and operative delivery, with bacterial translocation from the vaginal flora being the primary mechanism of infection.
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Chronic Endometritis and Fertility</h4>
            <p>Chronic endometritis involves persistent inflammation characterized by plasma cell infiltration of the endometrial stroma. This condition affects 0.2-46% of women depending on the population studied and is increasingly recognized as a cause of recurrent pregnancy loss and implantation failure in assisted reproduction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Immunohistochemical studies using CD138 staining reveal that chronic endometritis significantly alters endometrial gene expression, affecting over 400 genes involved in immune function, cell adhesion, and tissue remodeling. These molecular changes impair endometrial receptivity and may explain the reduced pregnancy rates observed in affected women.
        </div>

        <h3>Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)</h3>
        <p>PID represents infection and inflammation of the upper reproductive tract, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Microbiology and Pathogenesis</h4>
            <p>PID typically results from ascending infection by sexually transmitted pathogens, particularly Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, often in combination with anaerobic bacteria from the vaginal flora. The inflammatory response involves activation of toll-like receptors, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and recruitment of immune cells that can cause tissue damage and scarring.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Epidemiological data indicate that C. trachomatis accounts for 60-70% of PID cases, while N. gonorrhoeae causes 15-20% of cases. Mixed infections involving multiple organisms occur in 50-60% of cases, with Mycoplasma genitalium increasingly recognized as an important causative pathogen in 10-15% of PID cases.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Uterine Developmental Anomalies</h2>

        <h3>Müllerian Duct Anomalies</h3>
        <p>Uterine developmental anomalies result from abnormal development, fusion, or resorption of the müllerian ducts during embryogenesis, affecting 0.1-5.5% of women.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Classification and Embryology</h4>
            <p>The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) classification system divides müllerian anomalies into seven classes: normal, dysmorphic, aplastic, unicorporeal, bicorporeal, septate, and other anomalies. These result from specific developmental disruptions between weeks 6-20 of embryogenesis when the müllerian ducts form, fuse, and undergo selective resorption.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="trimester-box">
            <h3>Common Müllerian Anomalies and Their Impact</h3>
            <p><span class="highlight">Septate Uterus (35%):</span> Incomplete resorption of septum; highest miscarriage rate<br>
            <span class="highlight">Bicornuate Uterus (25%):</span> Incomplete fusion of müllerian ducts<br>
            <span class="highlight">Unicornuate Uterus (20%):</span> Unilateral müllerian duct development<br>
            <span class="highlight">Didelphys (15%):</span> Complete failure of müllerian duct fusion<br>
            <span class="highlight">Arcuate Uterus (3%):</span> Mild failure of fundal resorption<br>
            <span class="highlight">MRKH Syndrome (2%):</span> Müllerian duct aplasia or hypoplasia</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Reproductive Outcomes and Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>Uterine anomalies affect reproductive outcomes through multiple mechanisms including altered uterine blood flow, abnormal uterine contractions, cervical incompetence, and reduced uterine capacity. Septate uteri show the highest pregnancy loss rates (65-85%) due to implantation on poorly vascularized septal tissue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Meta-analysis of reproductive outcomes demonstrates that müllerian anomalies are associated with first-trimester miscarriage rates of 24.5% (vs 11.5% in normal uteri), second-trimester loss rates of 8.5% (vs 1.4%), and preterm delivery rates of 23.7% (vs 7.4%). Live birth rates vary significantly by anomaly type, ranging from 45% in septate uteri to 89% in arcuate uteri.
        </div>

        <h2>Age-Related Changes in Uterine Function</h2>

        <h3>Reproductive Aging and the Uterus</h3>
        <p>The uterus undergoes significant age-related changes that affect reproductive function and disease susceptibility throughout a woman's lifespan.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Cellular and Molecular Aging</h4>
            <p>Aging affects uterine function through multiple mechanisms including telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and altered gene expression patterns. <span class="highlight">Advanced maternal age is associated with reduced endometrial receptivity, altered implantation rates, and increased pregnancy complications</span> independent of ovarian aging effects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Perimenopause and Uterine Changes</h4>
            <p>During perimenopause, fluctuating hormone levels cause irregular endometrial development, altered menstrual patterns, and increased risk of endometrial pathology. The transition involves progressive decline in progesterone production leading to relative estrogen dominance and associated complications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Studies demonstrate that women over 40 show significantly altered endometrial gene expression patterns affecting 1,200+ genes involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and tissue homeostasis. These molecular changes correlate with reduced implantation rates (15-20% vs 40-50% in younger women) and increased miscarriage risk (25-35% vs 10-15%).
        </div>

        <h3>Postmenopausal Uterine Changes</h3>
        <p>After menopause, the uterus undergoes dramatic structural and functional changes due to estrogen deficiency.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Atrophic Changes</h4>
            <p>Postmenopausal estrogen deficiency causes progressive endometrial atrophy, with glandular epithelium becoming cuboidal or flattened and stromal cells decreasing in number. The myometrium also undergoes atrophy with reduced muscle mass and increased connective tissue deposition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Morphometric analysis reveals that postmenopausal endometrial thickness decreases to 1-4 mm (compared to 8-15 mm in reproductive years), while uterine volume decreases by 30-50% within 5 years of menopause. These changes reflect the profound dependence of uterine tissue on estrogen for maintenance of normal structure and function.
        </div>

        <h2>Uterine Contractility and Smooth Muscle Function</h2>

        <h3>Molecular Basis of Myometrial Contractions</h3>
        <p>Uterine smooth muscle contractions depend on complex molecular mechanisms involving calcium signaling, contractile proteins, and gap junction communication.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Excitation-Contraction Coupling</h4>
            <p>Myometrial contractions result from calcium-dependent activation of myosin ATPase through the actin-myosin sliding filament mechanism. Calcium influx occurs through voltage-gated calcium channels, while calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is triggered by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and ryanodine receptors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Gap Junction Communication</h4>
            <p>Coordinated uterine contractions require intercellular communication through gap junctions composed primarily of connexin-43 (Cx43). Gap junction expression increases dramatically during labor, rising 100-1000 fold to enable synchronous contractions necessary for effective delivery.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Electrophysiological studies demonstrate that human myometrium exhibits pacemaker activity with slow waves originating near the uterotubal junction and propagating toward the cervix at 2-4 cm/second. This electrical activity coordinates mechanical contractions and determines the efficiency of uterine emptying during menstruation and parturition.
        </div>

        <h3>Hormonal Regulation of Contractility</h3>
        <p>Uterine contractility is precisely regulated by hormonal influences that change throughout the menstrual cycle and pregnancy.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Estrogen and Progesterone Effects</h4>
            <p>Estrogen enhances myometrial contractility by increasing expression of contractile proteins, calcium channels, and gap junctions, while progesterone generally inhibits contractions by blocking calcium channels and promoting muscle relaxation. The estrogen-to-progesterone ratio determines the contractile state of the uterus at any given time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Intrauterine pressure studies show that basal uterine pressure varies from 8-12 mmHg during the follicular phase to 4-8 mmHg during the luteal phase, reflecting progesterone's inhibitory effects. During menstruation, pressures can reach 50-180 mmHg, similar to pressures observed during labor contractions (50-100 mmHg).
        </div>

        <h2>Diagnostic Approaches to Uterine Evaluation</h2>

        <h3>Imaging Technologies</h3>
        <p>Modern imaging techniques provide detailed visualization of uterine anatomy and pathology with high resolution and minimal invasiveness.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</h4>
            <p>MRI represents the gold standard for evaluating uterine anatomy and pathology, providing excellent soft tissue contrast and multiplanar imaging capabilities. T2-weighted sequences clearly delineate the endometrium, junctional zone, and myometrium, while contrast-enhanced sequences assess vascular patterns and tissue enhancement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Ultrasound and Doppler Assessment</h4>
            <p>Transvaginal ultrasound provides real-time imaging of uterine structure with high resolution, while Doppler studies assess uterine blood flow patterns. Three-dimensional ultrasound enables volume calculations and coronal plane visualization, improving evaluation of müllerian anomalies and fibroids.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Comparative studies demonstrate that MRI has 95-98% accuracy for diagnosing adenomyosis (vs 65-85% for ultrasound), 90-95% accuracy for fibroid mapping (vs 80-90% for ultrasound), and 100% accuracy for müllerian anomaly classification (vs 80-90% for ultrasound). However, ultrasound remains the first-line imaging modality due to cost-effectiveness and availability.
        </div>

        <h3>Histopathological Evaluation</h3>
        <p>Tissue sampling remains essential for diagnosing many uterine conditions and guiding treatment decisions.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Endometrial Biopsy Techniques</h4>
            <p>Endometrial sampling can be performed through office-based aspiration biopsy, dilatation and curettage (D&C), or hysteroscopically directed biopsy. Each technique has specific indications, advantages, and limitations in terms of diagnostic accuracy and patient comfort.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Studies comparing sampling techniques show that office endometrial biopsy has 90-98% sensitivity for detecting endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women, while hysteroscopic biopsy provides targeted sampling of focal lesions with 95-99% accuracy. The choice of technique depends on patient factors, suspected pathology, and available expertise.
        </div>

        <h2>Treatment Approaches and Mechanisms</h2>

        <h3>Medical Management of Uterine Conditions</h3>
        <p>Pharmacological treatments for uterine conditions target specific molecular pathways involved in disease pathogenesis.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Hormonal Therapies</h4>
            <p>Hormonal treatments modify the hormonal environment to suppress disease progression or symptoms. GnRH agonists create a hypoestrogenic state by suppressing pituitary LH and FSH release, while progestins directly antagonize estrogen effects and induce endometrial atrophy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Selective Progesterone Receptor Modulators (SPRMs)</h4>
            <p>SPRMs such as ulipristal acetate exert tissue-selective progesterone receptor modulation, leading to endometrial changes and fibroid volume reduction. These agents demonstrate both progesterone agonist and antagonist properties depending on the tissue and cellular context.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Clinical trials demonstrate that ulipristal acetate reduces fibroid volume by 35-50% over 3 months of treatment, with 80-90% of women experiencing cessation of heavy menstrual bleeding. The mechanism involves direct anti-proliferative effects on fibroid cells and modulation of extracellular matrix production.
        </div>

        <h3>Surgical Interventions</h3>
        <p>Surgical treatments range from conservative procedures preserving uterine function to definitive treatments removing the uterus entirely.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Minimally Invasive Procedures</h4>
            <p>Hysteroscopic procedures allow direct visualization and treatment of intrauterine pathology, including endometrial ablation, fibroid resection, and septum division. These techniques preserve uterine structure while addressing specific pathological conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Laparoscopic and Robotic Surgery</h4>
            <p>Laparoscopic approaches enable treatment of subserosal fibroids, ovarian endometriosis, and other pelvic pathology with reduced morbidity compared to open surgery. Robotic assistance provides enhanced dexterity and visualization for complex procedures requiring precise tissue dissection and suturing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="trimester-box">

        <h2>Fertility and Reproductive Outcomes</h2>

        <h3>Uterine Factors in Infertility</h3>
        <p>Uterine conditions account for 10-15% of female infertility cases through various mechanisms affecting implantation and pregnancy maintenance.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Implantation Window and Endometrial Receptivity</h4>
            <p>Successful pregnancy requires precise temporal coordination between embryo development and endometrial receptivity during the "implantation window" (cycle days 19-24). <span class="highlight">This process involves complex molecular signaling including integrins, selectins, immunomodulatory factors, and metabolic changes</span> that prepare the endometrium for embryo attachment and invasion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Transcriptomic analysis has identified over 200 genes that are differentially expressed during the implantation window, including HOXA10, LIF, COX-2, and IGFBP1. Aberrant expression of these genes in conditions such as endometriosis, fibroids, and chronic endometritis may explain reduced pregnancy rates in affected women.
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Uterine Blood Flow and Pregnancy Outcomes</h4>
            <p>Adequate uterine perfusion is essential for successful pregnancy outcomes. Doppler studies demonstrate that women with reduced uterine artery blood flow have increased risks of miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, and preeclampsia due to inadequate placental perfusion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Meta-analysis of uterine blood flow studies shows that women with uterine artery pulsatility index >2.6 in early pregnancy have 3.2-fold increased risk of pregnancy loss and 2.8-fold increased risk of preeclampsia. These findings highlight the importance of vascular factors in reproductive success and pregnancy complications.
        </div>

        <h2>Future Directions in Uterine Research</h2>
