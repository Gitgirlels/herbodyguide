        <h1>Pregnancy and Fertility Blood Tests: The Complete Scientific Guide</h1>
        <div class="intro">
            Blood testing represents the cornerstone of modern reproductive medicine, providing precise biochemical insights into fertility status, ovarian function, pregnancy viability, and fetal development. <span class="highlight">These laboratory analyses measure hormone concentrations, metabolic markers, and genetic indicators that guide clinical decision-making for millions of women worldwide</span>. From the groundbreaking discovery of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in 1927 to contemporary multi-marker screening panels, reproductive blood testing has revolutionized our understanding of conception, pregnancy, and fertility disorders. This comprehensive scientific guide examines the biochemistry, clinical applications, and interpretative principles of essential fertility and pregnancy blood tests, exploring their historical development, molecular mechanisms, and evidence-based utilization in optimizing reproductive health outcomes.
        </div>

        <h2>Historical Evolution of Reproductive Blood Testing</h2>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h3>The Discovery Era: 1920s-1940s</h3>
            <p>The foundation of reproductive endocrinology began with <span class="highlight">Selmar Aschheim and Bernhard Zondek's revolutionary 1927 discovery of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)</span> in the urine of pregnant women. Their "A-Z test" involved injecting urine samples into immature female mice and observing ovarian changes, establishing the first biological pregnancy test with 98% accuracy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Edgar Allen and Edward Doisy's 1923 identification of estrogen, followed by George Corner and Willard Allen's 1928 discovery of progesterone, laid the groundwork for understanding reproductive hormones. These pioneering researchers established that female reproductive cycles were governed by precise hormonal orchestrations, setting the stage for modern fertility testing.
        </div>

        <h3>The Immunoassay Revolution: 1960s-1980s</h3>
        <p>Rosalyn Yalow and Solomon Berson's 1959 development of radioimmunoassay (RIA) technology transformed reproductive medicine by enabling precise measurement of hormone concentrations in blood samples.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Breakthrough Achievements</h4>
            <p><strong>1960:</strong> First blood-based hCG measurement<br>
            <strong>1963:</strong> Luteinizing hormone (LH) quantification<br>
            <strong>1965:</strong> Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) assessment<br>
            <strong>1971:</strong> Estradiol and progesterone blood tests<br>
            <strong>1975:</strong> Prolactin measurement capability<br>
            <strong>1982:</strong> First enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            The transition from bioassay to immunoassay methods reduced testing time from days to hours while improving sensitivity 100-1000 fold. Modern chemiluminescent immunoassays can detect hCG concentrations as low as 1-2 mIU/mL, compared to early biological tests requiring 500-1000 mIU/mL for detection.
        </div>

        <h2>Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG): The Pregnancy Hormone</h2>

        <h3>Molecular Structure and Biochemistry</h3>
        <p>Human chorionic gonadotropin represents a glycoprotein hormone consisting of two non-covalently linked subunits: alpha (α) and beta (β). The α-subunit is identical to those found in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), while the β-subunit confers hCG's unique biological specificity.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Structural Characteristics</h4>
            <p>The hCG molecule contains 237 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 36,700 daltons. <span class="highlight">The β-subunit contains a unique 24-amino acid carboxy-terminal peptide (CTP) that extends the hormone's half-life to 24-36 hours</span>, compared to LH's 20-minute half-life. This extended stability enables hCG's sustained biological activity during early pregnancy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Synthesis and Secretion</h4>
            <p>Syncytiotrophoblast cells produce hCG beginning 6-7 days after fertilization, coinciding with blastocyst implantation. Production peaks at 8-10 weeks of gestation, reaching concentrations of 50,000-200,000 mIU/mL before declining to 10,000-20,000 mIU/mL by 16-20 weeks and remaining stable throughout the remainder of pregnancy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            hCG gene expression is regulated by multiple transcription factors including GCMa, AP-2, and cAMP response elements. Hypoxic conditions during early pregnancy enhance hCG production through hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) activation, explaining elevated levels observed in some pregnancy complications.
        </div>

        <h3>Physiological Functions of hCG</h3>
        <p>Beyond pregnancy detection, hCG serves multiple critical functions in early pregnancy maintenance and fetal development.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Corpus Luteum Rescue</h4>
            <p>hCG's primary function involves "rescuing" the corpus luteum from luteolysis by binding to LH/CG receptors and maintaining progesterone production. Without hCG stimulation, progesterone levels would decline 10-12 days post-ovulation, triggering menstruation and pregnancy loss.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Additional Biological Functions</h4>
            <p>hCG promotes angiogenesis in uterine and placental tissues, stimulates fetal Leydig cell testosterone production in male fetuses, and may contribute to maternal immunological tolerance of the fetal allograft. Recent research suggests hCG also influences maternal thyroid function and glucose metabolism.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Studies demonstrate that hCG concentrations double every 48-72 hours during the first 8-10 weeks of normal pregnancy, with doubling times of 1.4-2.1 days in 85% of viable pregnancies. Slower doubling times or declining levels often indicate non-viable pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or impending miscarriage.
        </div>

        <h3>Clinical Applications of hCG Testing</h3>
        <p>Modern hCG testing encompasses multiple applications beyond basic pregnancy detection, including pregnancy monitoring, fertility treatment, and oncological screening.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Pregnancy Confirmation and Dating</h4>
            <p>Serum β-hCG testing provides definitive pregnancy confirmation with >99% accuracy when performed 10-14 days after conception. Serial hCG measurements help assess pregnancy viability, with appropriate doubling patterns indicating normal early pregnancy development.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Ectopic Pregnancy Diagnosis</h4>
            <p>Abnormal hCG patterns combined with clinical symptoms help diagnose ectopic pregnancy, which occurs in 1-2% of pregnancies. <span class="highlight">The "discriminatory zone" concept suggests that transvaginal ultrasound should visualize an intrauterine pregnancy when β-hCG exceeds 3,500 mIU/mL</span>. Absence of intrauterine pregnancy above this threshold raises suspicion for ectopic implantation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="trimester-box">
            <h3>hCG Reference Ranges by Gestational Age</h3>
            <p><span class="highlight">3 weeks:</span> 5-50 mIU/mL<br>
            <span class="highlight">4 weeks:</span> 5-426 mIU/mL<br>
            <span class="highlight">5 weeks:</span> 18-7,340 mIU/mL<br>
            <span class="highlight">6 weeks:</span> 1,080-56,500 mIU/mL<br>
            <span class="highlight">7-8 weeks:</span> 7,650-229,000 mIU/mL<br>
            <span class="highlight">9-12 weeks:</span> 25,700-288,000 mIU/mL<br>
            <span class="highlight">13-16 weeks:</span> 13,300-254,000 mIU/mL<br>
            <span class="highlight">17-24 weeks:</span> 4,060-165,400 mIU/mL</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Progesterone: The Pregnancy Maintenance Hormone</h2>

        <h3>Molecular Biology and Synthesis</h3>
        <p>Progesterone, a C21 steroid hormone derived from cholesterol, serves as both an active hormone and precursor for other steroid hormones including cortisol, aldosterone, and testosterone.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Biosynthetic Pathway</h4>
            <p>Progesterone synthesis begins with cholesterol conversion to pregnenolone by cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1) in mitochondria. 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase subsequently converts pregnenolone to progesterone in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Sites of Production</h4>
            <p>Non-pregnant women produce progesterone primarily in corpus luteum cells following ovulation, with smaller contributions from adrenal glands and peripheral tissues. During pregnancy, the placental syncytiotrophoblast becomes the major production site after 8-10 weeks gestation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Progesterone's molecular mechanism involves binding to intracellular progesterone receptors (PR-A and PR-B), which function as ligand-activated transcription factors. These receptor-hormone complexes bind to progesterone response elements in target gene promoters, regulating expression of genes involved in endometrial receptivity, immune tolerance, and smooth muscle relaxation.
        </div>

        <h3>Physiological Actions in Reproduction</h3>
        <p>Progesterone orchestrates multiple aspects of reproductive function, from menstrual cycle regulation to pregnancy maintenance and parturition timing.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Endometrial Transformation</h4>
            <p>Progesterone transforms the estrogen-primed proliferative endometrium into a secretory, receptive state suitable for blastocyst implantation. This includes induction of decidualization, glycogen accumulation, and expression of adhesion molecules and growth factors essential for embryo attachment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Myometrial Quiescence</h4>
            <p>Progesterone maintains uterine muscle relaxation throughout pregnancy by reducing gap junction formation, decreasing oxytocin receptor expression, and inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. <span class="highlight">This "progesterone block" prevents premature labor and maintains pregnancy until term</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Progesterone levels rise from <1 ng/mL during the follicular phase to 10-25 ng/mL during the luteal phase in non-pregnant women. Early pregnancy concentrations reach 25-40 ng/mL by 8 weeks, increasing to 100-200 ng/mL in the third trimester as placental production dominates.
        </div>

        <h3>Clinical Applications of Progesterone Testing</h3>
        <p>Progesterone measurement serves multiple diagnostic and monitoring purposes in reproductive medicine.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Ovulation Confirmation</h4>
            <p>Mid-luteal progesterone testing (typically day 21 of a 28-day cycle) confirms ovulation occurrence. Levels >3 ng/mL indicate ovulation, while >10 ng/mL suggests adequate corpus luteum function. This testing helps diagnose anovulation and luteal phase defects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Early Pregnancy Assessment</h4>
            <p>Progesterone levels help assess early pregnancy viability. Concentrations >25 ng/mL are associated with viable intrauterine pregnancy, while levels <5 ng/mL often indicate non-viable pregnancy or ectopic implantation. Intermediate values require serial monitoring and correlation with hCG trends.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Luteal Support in IVF</h4>
            <p>Controlled ovarian stimulation and GnRH agonist protocols often result in luteal phase deficiency, requiring progesterone supplementation. Monitoring progesterone levels helps optimize luteal support dosing and timing in assisted reproductive technology cycles.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Estradiol (E2): The Primary Estrogen</h2>

        <h3>Biochemical Structure and Metabolism</h3>
        <p>17β-estradiol represents the most potent naturally occurring estrogen, synthesized from testosterone through aromatase enzyme (CYP19A1) activity in granulosa cells, theca cells, and extragonadal tissues.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Synthesis Pathway</h4>
            <p>Estradiol synthesis follows the classic two-cell, two-gonadotropin model: FSH stimulates granulosa cell aromatase activity while LH promotes theca cell androgen production. Granulosa cells convert theca-derived androgens to estrogens through aromatization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Molecular Mechanism of Action</h4>
            <p>Estradiol exerts its effects primarily through two nuclear estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) that function as ligand-activated transcription factors. <span class="highlight">ERα predominates in reproductive tissues and mediates most fertility-related estrogen effects</span>, while ERβ shows broader tissue distribution and may modulate ERα activity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Estradiol exhibits circadian and ultradian rhythms with pulsatile secretion patterns reflecting hypothalamic GnRH release. This pulsatility is essential for normal reproductive function, as continuous estrogen exposure can suppress gonadotropin secretion and ovarian function.
        </div>

        <h3>Reproductive Functions of Estradiol</h3>
        <p>Estradiol orchestrates follicular development, endometrial proliferation, and the complex hormonal cascades governing ovulation.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Follicular Development</h4>
            <p>Rising estradiol levels during the follicular phase reflect growing follicle maturation and granulosa cell proliferation. Estradiol promotes follicle growth through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms while exerting negative feedback on FSH secretion, leading to single dominant follicle selection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>LH Surge Triggering</h4>
            <p>Peak estradiol concentrations (>200 pg/mL for >48 hours) switch from negative to positive feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, triggering the preovulatory LH surge. This biphasic feedback mechanism ensures precise timing of ovulation relative to optimal follicle maturity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Normal menstrual cycle estradiol ranges from 20-80 pg/mL during early follicular phase, peaking at 200-400 pg/mL pre-ovulation, then declining to 80-200 pg/mL during the luteal phase. Postmenopausal levels typically fall below 20 pg/mL due to ovarian senescence.
        </div>

        <h3>Clinical Applications of Estradiol Testing</h3>
        <p>Estradiol measurement provides crucial information for fertility assessment, cycle monitoring, and hormonal disorder diagnosis.</p>

        <h2>Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH): The Follicle Maturation Signal</h2>

        <h3>Molecular Characteristics and Regulation</h3>
        <p>FSH belongs to the glycoprotein hormone family, sharing its α-subunit with LH, hCG, and TSH while possessing a unique β-subunit that confers biological specificity.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Structure and Half-Life</h4>
            <p>FSH contains 204 amino acids with extensive glycosylation that influences biological activity and metabolic clearance. The hormone's half-life of 3-4 hours is longer than LH (20 minutes) due to different carbohydrate modifications affecting hepatic clearance rates.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Hypothalamic-Pituitary Regulation</h4>
            <p>GnRH pulses stimulate FSH synthesis and secretion from anterior pituitary gonadotroph cells. FSH release is modulated by negative feedback from estradiol, inhibin B, and activin, creating a complex regulatory network that coordinates follicle development with hormonal status.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            FSH receptor (FSHR) belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor family and activates adenylyl cyclase upon ligand binding. This increases intracellular cAMP levels, activating protein kinase A and downstream signaling cascades that promote granulosa cell proliferation, differentiation, and steroidogenesis.
        </div>

        <h3>Physiological Actions in Folliculogenesis</h3>
        <p>FSH drives early follicle development and prepares dominant follicles for ovulation through multiple mechanisms.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Granulosa Cell Proliferation</h4>
            <p>FSH stimulates granulosa cell mitosis and differentiation, increasing follicle size and hormone production capacity. FSH also induces aromatase expression, enabling estradiol synthesis from theca-derived androgens.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Dominant Follicle Selection</h4>
            <p>During the mid-follicular phase, FSH levels decline due to rising estradiol and inhibin B feedback. Only follicles with sufficient FSH receptor density and sensitivity survive this decline, ensuring single dominant follicle selection in normal cycles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            FSH reference ranges vary by menstrual cycle phase: early follicular phase 3-10 mIU/mL, mid-cycle surge 5-20 mIU/mL, and luteal phase 2-8 mIU/mL. Postmenopausal levels typically exceed 25-30 mIU/mL due to loss of ovarian feedback inhibition.
        </div>

        <h3>Clinical Significance of FSH Testing</h3>
        <p>FSH measurement provides fundamental information about hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function and ovarian reserve status.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Ovarian Reserve Assessment</h4>
            <p>Day 3 FSH testing serves as a traditional marker of ovarian reserve, with elevated levels (>10-15 mIU/mL) indicating diminished reserve and reduced fertility treatment success rates. <span class="highlight">FSH levels >25 mIU/mL strongly suggest severely compromised ovarian function</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Menstrual Disorder Diagnosis</h4>
            <p>FSH patterns help differentiate between primary ovarian insufficiency (elevated FSH), hypothalamic amenorrhea (low FSH), and PCOS (normal to low FSH with elevated LH). These diagnostic distinctions guide appropriate treatment strategies.</p>
        </div>

            <h4>IVF Protocol Selection</h4>
            <p>Baseline FSH levels influence stimulation protocol selection and medication dosing in assisted reproductive technology. Higher FSH levels may require more aggressive stimulation or alternative protocols to achieve adequate ovarian response.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Luteinizing Hormone (LH): The Ovulation Trigger</h2>

        <h3>Biochemical Properties and Secretion Patterns</h3>
        <p>LH represents a crucial gonadotropin hormone that triggers ovulation and corpus luteum formation through its dramatic mid-cycle surge.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Molecular Structure</h4>
            <p>LH consists of 204 amino acids arranged in α- and β-subunits linked non-covalently. The β-subunit (LHβ) determines biological specificity and receptor binding affinity, while the α-subunit is identical across all glycoprotein hormones.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Pulsatile Secretion</h4>
            <p>LH exhibits characteristic pulsatile secretion reflecting hypothalamic GnRH release patterns. Pulse frequency varies across the menstrual cycle: every 90 minutes during the follicular phase, increasing to every 60 minutes during the LH surge, then decreasing to every 4 hours during the luteal phase.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            The LH surge represents one of the most dramatic hormonal events in human physiology, with levels increasing 3-10 fold over 24-48 hours. This surge triggers a cascade of molecular events including resumption of meiosis I, cumulus expansion, follicle wall weakening, and ovulation approximately 36-40 hours after surge initiation.
        </div>

        <h3>Physiological Functions in the Ovary</h3>
        <p>LH coordinates the final stages of follicle maturation, ovulation, and corpus luteum development through specific cellular targets and signaling pathways.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Theca Cell Stimulation</h4>
            <p>LH binds to receptors on theca cells, activating cAMP-dependent pathways that stimulate androgen production. These androgens serve as substrates for granulosa cell aromatase, enabling estradiol synthesis essential for follicle maturation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Ovulation Mechanics</h4>
            <p>The LH surge activates multiple pathways leading to ovulation: stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis, activation of proteolytic enzymes, induction of cumulus expansion, and resumption of oocyte meiosis. <span class="highlight">Peak LH levels trigger expression of ovulation-associated genes including PTGS2, ADAMTS1, and HAS2</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Corpus Luteum Formation</h4>
            <p>Post-ovulation, LH supports corpus luteum development and progesterone production. LH receptors on luteinized granulosa and theca cells maintain steroidogenic activity until either pregnancy (hCG rescue) or luteolysis occurs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Normal LH levels range from 2-10 mIU/mL during the follicular phase, surge to 15-80 mIU/mL at mid-cycle, then decline to 1-15 mIU/mL during the luteal phase. The LH:FSH ratio typically remains <2:1 in normal cycling women, while PCOS patients often show ratios >2:1 due to preferential LH elevation.
        </div>

        <h3>Clinical Applications of LH Testing</h3>
        <p>LH measurement serves multiple purposes in reproductive medicine, from ovulation prediction to hormonal disorder diagnosis.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Ovulation Prediction</h4>
            <p>LH surge detection helps time intercourse or intrauterine insemination for optimal conception chances. Home ovulation predictor kits detect the LH surge, indicating that ovulation will occur within 24-48 hours.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>PCOS Diagnosis</h4>
            <p>Elevated LH levels and increased LH:FSH ratios support PCOS diagnosis, particularly when combined with clinical hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovarian morphology. However, normal LH levels don't exclude PCOS, as up to 40% of PCOS patients have normal LH concentrations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Hypothalamic-Pituitary Function Assessment</h4>

        </div>

        <h2>Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH): The Modern Ovarian Reserve Marker</h2>

        <h3>Discovery and Molecular Biology</h3>
        <p>Anti-Müllerian hormone, discovered by Alfred Jost in 1947, was initially recognized for its role in male sexual differentiation. Its application in female fertility assessment emerged in the 1990s following recognition of its production by ovarian granulosa cells.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Protein Structure and Processing</h4>
            <p>AMH belongs to the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily and is synthesized as a 560-amino acid precursor protein. <span class="highlight">The mature hormone undergoes proteolytic cleavage to generate N- and C-terminal fragments, with the C-terminal fragment (AMH-C) providing biological activity</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Ovarian AMH Production</h4>
            <p>In females, granulosa cells of preantral and small antral follicles (2-6mm diameter) produce AMH. Production begins during fetal development, peaks during reproductive years, and declines with age, becoming undetectable after menopause.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            AMH exerts its biological effects through binding to AMH receptor type II (AMHRII) and subsequent recruitment of type I receptors, activating SMAD signaling pathways. In the ovary, AMH inhibits initial follicle recruitment from the primordial pool and reduces FSH sensitivity of growing follicles, serving as a brake on folliculogenesis.
        </key-point>

        <h3>AMH in Ovarian Physiology</h3>
        <p>AMH serves as a critical regulator of follicle development and provides an accurate reflection of ovarian reserve status.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Follicle Pool Regulation</h4>
            <p>AMH prevents excessive recruitment of primordial follicles, helping maintain the resting follicle pool throughout reproductive life. This "gatekeeper" function ensures gradual rather than rapid depletion of ovarian reserves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>FSH Sensitivity Modulation</h4>
            <p>AMH reduces FSH receptor expression and cAMP responses in granulosa cells, decreasing follicle sensitivity to FSH stimulation. This mechanism contributes to dominant follicle selection by creating a competitive advantage for follicles with lower AMH production.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            AMH levels correlate strongly with antral follicle count (r=0.7-0.8) and decline predictably with age. Mean AMH concentrations range from 4-7 ng/mL in women aged 25-30, declining to 1-3 ng/mL by age 35-40, and <0.5 ng/mL by age 45-50. Individual variation is substantial, with 10th-90th percentiles spanning 3-5 fold differences at any given age.

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>TSH Structure and Regulation</h4>
            <p>TSH shares the common α-subunit with other glycoprotein hormones while possessing a unique β-subunit that binds to thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors (TSHR) on thyroid follicular cells. Hypothalamic TRH and negative feedback from thyroid hormones regulate TSH secretion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Reproductive Effects of Thyroid Dysfunction</h4>
            <p>Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism disrupt reproductive function through effects on GnRH pulsatility, sex hormone-binding globulin production, and direct ovarian actions. <span class="highlight">Subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH >2.5 mIU/L) is associated with reduced fertility, increased miscarriage risk, and adverse pregnancy outcomes</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-point">
            Thyroid hormones modulate granulosa cell function, influence estradiol and progesterone production, and affect endometrial receptivity. Thyroid dysfunction can cause anovulation, luteal phase defects, and implantation failures, all reversible with appropriate thyroid hormone treatment.
        </div>

        <h3>Pregnancy-Specific Thyroid Considerations</h3>
        <p>Pregnancy significantly alters thyroid physiology, requiring modified reference ranges and monitoring protocols.</p>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>hCG-Thyroid Interactions</h4>
            <p>Rising hCG levels during early pregnancy stimulate thyroid hormone production through structural similarity to TSH, leading to physiological suppression of TSH levels. This explains the lower TSH reference ranges recommended during pregnancy (0.1-2.5 mIU/L first trimester).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anatomy-section">
            <h4>Iodine Requirements</h4>
            <p>Pregnancy increases iodine requirements to 250 μg/daily due to increased thyroid hormone production, renal iodine losses, and fetal thyroid development needs. Iodine deficiency can impair fetal neurodevelopment and increase pregnancy complications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="statistic">
            Studies demonstrate that maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy, even when subclinical, increases risks of preterm delivery (OR 1.7), placental abruption (OR 3.0), and fetal growth restriction (OR 2.1). Treatment with levothyroxine reduces these risks when initiated early in pregnancy.
