                <h2>What is Menstruation? The Scientific Foundation</h2>
                
                <div class="key-point">Menstruation, commonly referred to as a "period," is a natural biological process that occurs in the reproductive system of individuals with uteruses. Scientifically, it represents the cyclical shedding of the endometrium (the inner lining of the uterus) when pregnancy does not occur.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="anatomy-section">
                <h3>The Menstrual Cycle: A Complex Hormonal Orchestra</h3>
                
                <p>The menstrual cycle is controlled by a sophisticated interplay of hormones, primarily:</p>
                </div>
        
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)</strong> - stimulates ovarian follicle development</li>
                    <li><strong>Luteinizing Hormone (LH)</strong> - triggers ovulation</li>
                    <li><strong>Estrogen</strong> - builds up the endometrial lining</li>
                    <li><strong>Progesterone</strong> - maintains the endometrial lining</li>
                </ul>
    
         <p>The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days, though normal cycles can range from 21 to 35 days. The menstrual phase itself typically lasts 3-7 days, during which approximately 30-40 milliliters of menstrual fluid is expelled, consisting of <span class="highlight">blood, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue.</span></p>
    
                <h3>Key Statistics About Menstruation</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Approximately <span class="highlight">1.9 billion people</span> worldwide menstruate</li>
                    <li>The average person menstruates for about <strong>40 years</strong> of their lifetime</li>
                    <li>This translates to roughly <span class="highlight">400-500 menstrual cycles</span> in a lifetime</li>
                    <li>Studies show that <strong>80% of menstruating individuals</strong> experience some form of premenstrual symptoms</li>
                    <li>Dysmenorrhea (painful periods) affects <span class="highlight">45-95%</span> of menstruating individuals globally</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Historical Treatment of Menstruation: A Legacy of Misunderstanding</h2>
    
                <p>Throughout history, menstruation has been shrouded in myth, superstition, and often fear. The lack of scientific understanding led to discriminatory practices that persisted for millennia and continue to impact societies today.</p>
    
                <h3>Ancient Civilizations and Religious Texts</h3>
                
                <div class="key-point">Ancient civilizations held varied but often negative views of menstruation. In ancient Rome, Pliny the Elder wrote that menstrual blood could turn wine sour and kill crops. The Hebrew Bible's Leviticus declared menstruating women "unclean" for seven days, requiring purification rituals. Similar taboos existed across cultures. Ancient Greek physician Hippocrates believed that menstrual blood was a way for women to purge "bad blood," while medieval European texts suggested that menstruating women's gaze could cloud mirrors and their touch could spoil food.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>The Scientific Revolution: Slow Progress</h3>
                
                <p>Even as scientific understanding advanced, menstruation remained poorly understood. In the 19th century, physicians believed that menstruation drained women's energy and intellectual capacity. This "scientific" justification was used to exclude women from higher education and professional careers.</p>
    
                <p>Dr. Edward Clarke's influential 1873 book "Sex in Education" argued that <span class="highlight">intellectual work during menstruation could cause sterility and mental breakdown.</span> These theories, though later debunked, shaped policy and social attitudes for decades.</p>
    
                <h3>Modern Understanding Emerges</h3>
                
                <p>It wasn't until the 1930s that scientists began to understand the hormonal mechanisms behind menstruation. The discovery of reproductive hormones and their cyclical patterns revolutionized medical understanding, though social stigma persisted.</p>

                <h2>Contemporary Challenges: Statistics and Global Impact</h2>
    
                <h3>Period Poverty and Access Issues</h3>
                
                <div class="statistic">
                <ul>
                    <li>Globally, <span class="highlight">500 million people</span> lack access to menstrual products and adequate facilities</li>
                    <li>In the United States, <strong>1 in 5 students</strong> have struggled to afford period products</li>
                    <li>Studies show that <strong>58% of women</strong> have experienced period shame</li>
                    <li>Research indicates that <strong>73% of women</strong> have experienced period-related discrimination in the workplace</li>
                </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Educational Impact</h3>
                
                <div class="statistic">UNESCO reports that inadequate menstrual hygiene management causes girls to miss an average of <strong>5 days of school per month</strong> in some regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, approximately <strong>1 in 10 school-age girls</strong> miss school during menstruation.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Economic Consequences</h3>
                
              <div class="key-point">The economic impact is substantial. The average person spends approximately <strong>$6,000-$8,000</strong> on menstrual products over their lifetime. In many countries, these products are still subject to luxury taxes, despite being biological necessities.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</span> - affects 6-12% of reproductive-aged individuals</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Endometriosis</span> - impacts approximately 10% of reproductive-aged individuals</li>
                    <li><strong>Thyroid disorders</strong> - can cause menstrual irregularities in up to 68% of cases</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Tracking and Technology</h3>
                
                <p>Research shows that <strong>200+ million people</strong> worldwide use period-tracking apps. Studies indicate that consistent tracking can improve healthcare outcomes, with <strong>89% of users</strong> reporting better understanding of their cycles.</p>
