              The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days, though normal cycles can range from 21 to 35 days. The menstrual phase itself typically lasts 3-7 days, during which approximately 30-40 milliliters of menstrual fluid is expelled, consisting of blood, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue.

               Pregnancy dating discrepancies occur in approximately 25-30% of pregnancies due to natural variations in ovulation timing, implantation, and early embryonic development rates. The discovery of ovulation by Edgar Allen and Edward Doisy in 1923 revolutionized pregnancy dating accuracy. However, it wasn't until the development of ultrasound technology in the 1950s and its obstetric application in the 1960s that precise embryonic measurement became possible.</p>
