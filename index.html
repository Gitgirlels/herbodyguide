               Intrauterine insemination (IUI) represents one of the most commonly performed fertility treatments worldwide, with over 1.2 million cycles performed annually. This relatively simple yet scientifically sophisticated procedure involves placing prepared sperm directly into the uterus around the time of ovulation, bypassing potential barriers in the cervix and optimizing the chances of fertilization. Understanding the intricate biological mechanisms, success factors, and evidence-based protocols behind IUI is crucial for couples considering this fertility treatment option.

      Migraines impact ~1 in 5 women—about 3× the rate in men. Estrogen dips around menstruation often trigger attacks; “menstrual migraines” cluster from ~2 days before to 3 days after a period. Typical attacks last 4–72 hours with throbbing head pain, nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound.

    <p class="post-excerpt">
      Chronic undereating (low energy availability) can disrupt the hypothalamus and suppress GnRH, leading to irregular or missing periods (functional hypothalamic amenorrhea). It also lowers leptin and thyroid hormones, raises cortisol, and increases bone-loss risk by reducing estrogen, which supports bone formation. Common signs include fatigue, feeling cold, hair shedding, and stress fractures. Restoring adequate calories, dietary fat, and easing excessive training typically allows cycles and bone markers to recover over time.

              The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days, though normal cycles can range from 21 to 35 days. The menstrual phase itself typically lasts 3-7 days, during which approximately 30-40 milliliters of menstrual fluid is expelled, consisting of blood, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue.

               Pregnancy dating discrepancies occur in approximately 25-30% of pregnancies due to natural variations in ovulation timing, implantation, and early embryonic development rates. The discovery of ovulation by Edgar Allen and Edward Doisy in 1923 revolutionized pregnancy dating accuracy. However, it wasn't until the development of ultrasound technology in the 1950s and its obstetric application in the 1960s that precise embryonic measurement became possible.</p>

Understanding D antigens, partial D variants, and maternal-fetal blood incompatibility reveals why precise blood work is absolutely critical before cesarean delivery, and why your test results might seem contradictory.

            Pregnancy triggers an extraordinary cascade of physiological changes mediated by dramatic hormonal fluctuations, metabolic adaptations, and immune system modifications. These changes manifest as a constellation of symptoms that vary significantly among individuals in timing, severity, and duration. This comprehensive scientific guide examines the ten most common pregnancy symptoms experienced by expectant mothers, exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms, prevalence statistics from large-scale epidemiological studies, and evidence-based management strategies. Understanding these symptoms from a scientific perspective empowers women to recognize normal pregnancy changes while identifying when medical consultation may be warranted.
